# Digital-Design
This repository contains the following 2 projects based on Digital Circuit Design

1. 4:1 Multiplexer using Dynamic CMOS Logic
   This project is implemented on the software Cadence Virtuoso. The developement of the final multiplexer begins at lowest level, by using MOSFETS, then eveltually higher level 
   circuits are built by importing previously developed circuits. All circuits are verified by obtaining their transient analysis waveforms on Cadence tool. The complete and detailed
   explanation is provided in pdf along with circuits, their waveforms and input parameters.

2. Clock Frequency Divider:
   In this report I have designed and implemented clock divider module using parameters (divided by 7). This report contains algorithm, state encoding table, output table, state table, 
   state transition diagram, design code and testbench. The code was written on Quartus Prime Lite (20.1) in system verilog, hardware implementation was done on the FPGA board DE 10 LITE 
   and output was generated. Output of simulation was obtained and verified on FPGA board.
