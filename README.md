# Digital-Design
This repository contains the following 2 projects based on Digital Circuit Design

1. 4:1 Multiplexer using Dynamic CMOS Logic
   This project is implemented on the software Cadence Virtuoso. The developement of the final multiplexer begins at lowest level, by using MOSFETS, then eveltually higher level 
   circuits are built by importing previously developed circuits. All circuits are verified by obtaining their transient analysis waveforms on Cadence tool. The complete and detailed
   explanation is provided in the pdf along with circuits, their waveforms and input parameters.

2. Clock Frequency Divider:
   The design code and testbench code for this project is written in System Verilog on Intel Quartus Prime Lite (20.1). The complete and detailed explanation of the design process, state 
   transition diagram and state tables is provided in the pdf along with diagrams. The output of the design was verified through simulation and hardware implementation on the FPGA board, 
   DE 10 LITE.
